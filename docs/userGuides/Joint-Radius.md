###User-Guide

A very simple tool to adjust a rig's skeleton radius easily.
<br>
Simply select a rig, launch the dialog and adjust joint-radius.
<br>
This tool is available in Mansur-Rig's main menu.
<br>
The tool is based on selection. In case the tool is launched and any Mansur-Rig isn't detected within the selection, it will simply be disabled. 
<br>
In this case simply close the dialog, select your rig, and re-launch.
