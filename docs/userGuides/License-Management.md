###Video Overview
<font>
In this video, I want to explain how to use Mansur-Rig's enterprise-level license manager.
<br>
We will go through the recently upgraded web app and all actions within it, which you can use to manage your Mansur-Rig licenses.
<br>
I'm sure you are already aware that Mansur-Rig's toolset and rigs require an active subscription to function properly.
<br>
Whether you are working alone, within a team, or managing a team, our web app is got you covered.
