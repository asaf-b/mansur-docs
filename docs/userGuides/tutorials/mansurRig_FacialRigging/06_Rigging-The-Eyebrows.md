###Video Overview
<font>
In this video, we are going to rig the eyebrows.
In this video, I also want to take you through my thought process when rigging the eyebrows.
I want to show you that in most cases, there is more then one solution to rig a component in Block.
So I want to create two types of setups for the eyebrows, I'll let you decide which one you think is best- let me know in the comments.
That will also be a good chance to see a few more attributes and features we didn't use so far.
