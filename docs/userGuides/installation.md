## Linux Notes
* As opposed to the Windows installer, the Linux version will install Mansur-Rig on the choosen maya version only. 
* The Linux installer is using the local Maya.env file to append the new envioronment variable instead of installing a system-wide persistant variable, as the installer can not assume system write permissions.
* In case you want to install Mansur-Rig on multiple versions of Maya, please repeat the installation (drag-drop) on every required Maya version.
