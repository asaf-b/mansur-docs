In order for Mansur-Rig toolset to work properly, you must be logged in using an account connected to an active subscription.
<br>
In case you haven't already, please  visit <a href="https://mansur-rig.com/" target = "_blank"><b>Mansur-Rig.com</b></a> to create an account and subscribe to a plan of your choosing.
<br>
Once you have an account and an active subscription, you will be able to successfully log-in and activate the product.
<br>
To do so, please open <b>My-Account</b> dialog via Mansur-Rig's main menu:

### Using a multi-seat subscription
In case you have a multi-seat subscription, a few more features will be of your interest.
<br>
#### Logging in with multiple machines at the same time

<ul type="1">
	<li>You are will be able to log-in with multiple machines at the same time.
	<li>The ammount of seats that are available within your subscription will be listed under your profile within the website.</li>
	<li>You can also see some of your license details via <b>My-Account</b> dialog, under <b>License-Details</b> dropdown menu
	<br>

</ul>
</font>

#### Managing Users
In case you have multiple machines, your credentials can be used in two ways:
<font size =3>
<ol type="1">
	<li>As an <b>Admin</b> (Account Owner)</li>
	<li>As a <b>User</b>, which was given user credentials.</li>
</ol>

In case you own a multi-seat subscription, you might be interested in allowing multiple users, who are not yourself, to use your subscription (a member of your team most-likely).
<br>
In case you don't want to give your full credentials which can be used to do actions within your account, you can alternatively use the <b>User Password</b> field of your account.
<br>
This field can be edited via Mansur-Rig's website, in <b>My-Profile</b> section.
<br>
Now, the user you want to give access to your account can log-in as a <b>User</b>, which will give him "read-only" access to your account.
<br>
You, as an <b>Admin</b> are able to control access to your account, and even force log-out any user using the <b>Manage-Users</b> section in <b>My-Account</b> dialog:

<hr>

### Logging in with different machines
In case you have a single seat subscription and wish to use it on different machines (i.e Home, Office), you are welcome to do so.
<br>
If in any case you did not log-out a machine, and want to use a second one, you can always log-out machines as an Admin remotely in order to release the seat using <b>Manage-Users</b> section in <b>My-Account</b> dialog.
