## Mansur-Rig 2.6.0
Released 01 Jan 2025

### General
<ul>
	<li><b>Maya 2025 Support for Windows</b>- Due to increasing complications and hardware requirements, Mansur-Rig 2.6 now supports Maya 2025 for Windows platform only. Linux support <b>IS NOT</b> dropped, only delayed. I'm still working hard on implementing support for Maya 2025 for linux as well. Since it is taking longer, I didn't want to delay the release for windows.</li>
	<li><b>PyMel library was moved to an internal Mansur-Rig dependency</b>- Due to some distribution issues/delays with the open source library PyMel, I decided to move this dependency to an internal component within Mansur-Rig, so I can be in control of it. That also means that all previous PyMel installation requirements are no longer required.</li>
