- <a href = "../../userGuides/CNS-Tool/"><b><u>CNS Tool Documentation</u></b></a> added
- Predefined CNS Ctrls Added to rig top attributes. Often it is needed to create CNS controls for animators. As it is slightly inconvenient to do so manually or using custom scripts, a new predefined-CNS controls attribute was added. A CNS control will be created automatically post-construction for every input control within the new attribute list.

- Custom-Scripts relative paths- In some cases, relative paths for custom scripts can be very useful. When working in a non-production environment, it is sometimes useful to point to a custom script using a relative path to the Maya Project root directory. In case the selected custom script path is within the current Maya Project directory, a new pop-up question window will load, allowing users to choose to convert the selected path to a relative path format. This new relative path will be re-converted to the absolute path dynamically pre-execution.

- Custom Guides Shapes Posing- Saving poses will now store custom guides shape when relevant. 
- curveZipB Module now supports bind tweaks for deforming eyelids pre-construction. This was created mainly to allow rigging a closed eyes model. Use the new "doBindTweaks" attribute within the curveZipB module- that will create edittable curves that can be editted pre-construction.

### Bug fixes
- Twisting Issues with upper limb up node are now resolved. In previous versions, there were a few scenarios where the shoulder flipped. This has been resolved both in Limb & Hind-Limb modules, and the upper section of the limb is now fully stable. 
- Errors when trying to batch render a scene with a Block-Rig present- Fixed. Batch rendering with a Block rig within the scene is now fully supported.
- Squash module decendents behaviour- Squash module decentent behaviour was fully stabalized and will now yeild expected results.
