## Mansur-Rig 1.4.2
Released 17 Oct 2021

### Features
- A completly new and very powerful feature- Mns-Volume-Joints! You can now create volume joints to refine and enhence you deformations. These joints are driven by 2 parent+child joints. Using the new UI, you can choose actions (translation/scale) to take for every angle direction between the 2 joint drivers. Please see the <a href = "../../userGuides/Volume-Joints/"><b><u> full documentation here</u></b></a> for full info.

- New "Text Control Shape" feature added as a core ability. You can now select to create a Nurbs-Curve text control shape. This is mainly useful for Attribute-Host controls, in case you want to make them extra distict by setting their control shapes to "Vis", "UI" or "FK/IK" for example.
