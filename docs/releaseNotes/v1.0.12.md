### Bug fixes
- #24 - sleeve option for limb not working properly - sleeve option in limb module will now build correctly.
- #29 - custom scripts - Custom scripts were executing regardless of the 'exec' checkbox state. This bug is now fixed and the checkbox will determine the execution.
- #30 - automatic isFacial - New module creation under a module that is marked as 'isFacial' will now be automatically set to isFacial as well as default.
- #31 - groups ending with _ctrl - Many 'non-animatable' transform nodes were named with a suffix of 'ctrl', which is faulty when seraching for '*_ctrl' suffix when setting keys in animation. All of these controls are now re-implemented with a new suffix - 'techCtl' to avoid these issues.
