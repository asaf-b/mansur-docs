## Mansur-Rig 2.4.0
Released 14 Nov 2023

### Features
<ul>
<li><b>Updated Prefs gathering methods to increase performance</b> - An unexpected performance impact bug was found related to prefs gathering mehthods. The entire structure for prefs gathering was updated, and a <b>50% increase in all actions (!!!)</b> speed is logged!</li>
<li><b>Module Settings - int increment rule</b> - Added an ability to create an increment rule within int type settings in module-settings and dyn-UI.</li>
<li><b>All module int increment rule setting pass</b> - Implemented the new int-increment rule in all relevant modules.</li>
<li><b>Preferences Update trigger</b> - Added trigger in centralized location to find and fix preferences in case they are currupt/out-of-date.</li>
<li><b>Static "Picker-Images" directory in preferences</b> - Added a new preference named "Picker images fallback path". This path can now be used to centralize all picker images in a single location. This is convenient for any user, but especially important when using pipelines that use different file structures for rig. Now in case there is a need, use this preferece to specify a centralized location for all picker images. This location will be used for searching picker images in case the default location was not found.</li>
<li><b>Remote-Control style Ctrls symmetry</b> - Control shapes symmetry action will now symmetrize remote-control style shapes and positions.</li>
<li><b>"Save Default Values" trigger for ui-style controls, on "extract shapes"</b> - For ease of use, now "extract shapes" action will trigger a "save custom default values" for remote-control style controls.</li>
<li><b>Prevent all guide-related actions in Block while in constructed state</b> - Implemented.</li>
<li><b>Game Exporter - Indication for ongoing process</b> - Implemented.</li>
<li><b>Game Exporter - Custom-Attributes Extraction ability</b> - Game exporter is now enhenced with an ability to extract additional channel-box attributes. Relevant for blend-shapes drivers, texture-switchers etc.</li>
<li><b>CurveZipB Module- Attachments joint struct Manual parameters adjustments</b> - Added an ability to manually adjust indevidual joint placements for the attachment (eyelashes) layer.</li>
</ul>
