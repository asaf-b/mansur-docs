### Modules
<ul>
	<li><b>Remote-Control</b>-
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
			<li>Example use:
				<figure>
				  <img src="../../images/releaseNotes/250_remoteCtrl.gif"/>
				</figure>
			</li>
			<li>
				<u>Best used for</u>: Blend Shape Targets, Facial-Remotes, General Extra-Setups
			</li>
			<li>
				This module, upon construction, will create a remote-control style control.
				<br>It will create a frame, with a control within, limited to that frame.
				<br>The frame range is dictated by the settings below.
				<br>Use the min-max values for both vertical and horizontal directions to create the remote that best fitting to your needs.
				<br>You can freely use both vertical and horizontal directions in combination.
				<br>This type of control is often seen when creating a blend-shape-based facial rig, with an adjacent remote control to easily and visually animate the targets instead of using the channel box directly.
				<br>
				<br>Also, you can control the target value range for your control.
				<br>That means that the control and target ranges can differ.
				<br>For example, a blend shape target with values between 0 and 1 is needed to be controlled.
				<br>You can set the control range between 0 and 5, while keeping the target range between 0 and 1, which will result in a slower behaving control for more fidelity.
				<br>
				<br>The target connection is handled post-construction so connecting to constructed objects is also possible.
				<br>Multiple targets can be input into the same target. Simply select multiple targets and input. Alternatively manually input the targets, separated by commas.

</ul>

### Features
<ul>
	<li><b>Game Exporter</b>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
			<li><i><u>Export multiple rigs from the same scene</i></u>- It is now possible to export animations for multiple rigs at the same time. This feature is backward compatible.</li>
			<li><i><u>Blend-Shapes Handling</u></i>- Game exporter is now able to handle blend shapes as well as skin clusters. In case export-geometry is set to True, and a blend-shape node is found on one of the located skinned geometries, the game exporter will automatically re-create the blend-shape nodes and keys on export.</li>
			<li><i><u>Export geometry from mdlGrp only</i></u>- Normally, all skinned meshes to the selected skeleton will be extracted. If this option is checked, only geometry under Block's Model-Group will be extracted.</li>
			<li><i><u>"Root joint reset" option</u></i>- If this option is checked, after asset/animation extraction, animation for the root joint will be deleted, and transforms will be reset to origin.</li>

	<li><b>Picker</b>- multiple picker instances are now supported.

		</figure>
	</li>
	<li><b>Block Builder</b>- A new global setting is introduced: <i><u>Interp Joints Isolated Controls.</i></u>
		<br>When this setting is checked, and the current module is set to create Interpolation-Joints, on construction all Interpolation joints will receive individual isolated ctrl on top of any previous behaviour.

		</figure>
	</li>
	<li><b>Joint Radius Tool</b> 
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
			<li>This tool is now set to update once a selection within the scene changes, to avoid needing to reset this tool.</li>
			<li>This tool now supports Block rigs with namespaces, to enable use in animation as well.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Visibility attribute on all controls made un-keyable</b>- In previous versions, the visibility channel for all controls was controlled via an AnimCurves nodes, which caused the visibility channel to appear in Maya's Graph-Editor. To avoid this inconvenience, a new dedicated node was introduced- mnsModuleVis. Instead of using Maya's AnimCurves node, this new node is used to prevent control's visibility channel appear in the Graph-Editor.</li>
	<li><b>Change IK-FK attribute on Limb modules to an Int</b>- IK-FK attribute float blending was causing multiple issues on many cases, so it was changed to an Int type, disabling blending.</li>
</ul>

### Bug Fixes
- Maya 2022 and above version Manager download doesn't work- Fixed.
- Game Exporter- Skin isn't transferring cleanly- Fixed.
- LipsB- Weird issue with Maya 2022 onwards- joints are not created on selected vertices- Fixed.
- Absolute pose loading- implemented load sequence by highest descendent downwards to make sure poses are loaded correctly in absolute mode.
- Maya 2024 PyMel attr setMin and setMax don't work- Fixed. Changed to Maya's setAttr command.
- Remote-Control style controls are storing default poses post construction- Fixed. The auto trigger for default value save on construction was removed.
- Pose modes attributes aren't set to hidden- Fixed.
- Picker- Selection display issues with a scene containing 2 rigs without a namespace- Fixed.
- When using limb/hindLimb modules in combination with the foot module, the limb's last interp joint should be excluded from skinning-joints selection- Implemented.
- IK-FK match- sometimes doesn't match exactly- Fixed. IK-FK Match function was reviewed and corrected.
- Free Control- Using free control without a joint is causing sub-module joints to build with offset- Fixed.


### mnsMayaPlugins v 2.5
- <b>mnsModuleVis Node</b>- A Simple dedicated node to control module visibility.<br>Previously was done using 3 animCurvesUU nodes, this is designed to replace them.

### Transition Log
- <b>Rigs built using this version of Mansur-Rig are <u>NOT backward compatible</u>. Rigs built using this version can only be opened using 2.5.0 and above, since a new node was introduced into the core build (mnsModuleVis).</b>
- Please use the centralized "Update Rig" utility button in Block's utility tab to update rigs built with previous versions of Mansur-Rig.
