### Pricing/Subscriptions [Answers]

#### What is the key difference between the *Gold* and *Silver* subscription plans?
> The key difference is the fact the the *Gold* subscription is targeted for Riggers, while the *Silver* subscription is targeted for Animators.
>
> * The *Gold* license has no restrictions. All actions/tools/nodes within Mansur-Rig are open for *Gold* subscribers.
> * The *Silver* license is a 'Read-Only' subscription. Meaning that all *Build* actions, or *Change* actions are not avilable. Although all animation related tools are avilable. This license is designed for Animators who only need to **use** rigs created using Mansur-Rig, rather then build/change them.

<br>
<br>

#### Can I sell rigs created using Mansur-Rig?
> Yes, absolutely.  
> Anyone is free to sell rigs created using Mansur-Rig, without any restrictions, and without any prior approval, and at any price.  
> Also, there is no requirement to credit Mansur-Rig. Although that will help support Mansur-Rig and will be appreciated.  
> <br>
> With that said, remember that Mansur-Rig is required (installation and license) in order for the rigs your are selling to function.  
> So anyone you sell your rigs to, will require to install and validate Mansur-Rig.

<br>

#### I installed Mansur-Rig, and I don't see the menu in Maya
> * First, make sure the Maya version in question is within Mansur-Rig's supported versions, and that you are using a supported platform: <br>[*System-Requirements*](../../userGuides/System-Requirements/)
> * If so, make sure PyMel is installed within the Maya version you are using: <br>[*2022 & 2023*](../../userGuides/System-Requirements/#maya-2022-2023-requirements) <br>[*2024*](../../userGuides/System-Requirements/#maya-2024-requirements)
> * Try to uninstall, then use the [*manual installation*](../../userGuides/installation/#manual-installation) instead. 
> * If non if the above make a difference, please send a support ticket to <br>**support@mansur-rig.com** <br>with as much information possible.

#### I'm a freelance rigging artist using Mansur-Rig. do my clients require Mansur-Rig?
> Yes.  
> Mansur-Rig is based on a dedicated custom C++ node library, that is the heart of it's operation.  
> In order for the Rigs created using Mansur-Rig to run, this solver-library is required. Without it, it won't function.  
> Moreover, Mansur-Rig's solvers will only function in case Mansur-Rig is activated using a valid license.  
> So, your clients will require the installation of Mansur-Rig, as well as a valid license to activate it within Maya for them to be able to use the rig you created using Mansur-Rig.  
> With that said, in case your clients only need to animate using the rig (not build it), they will only require the lower tier *Silver* license.  
> <br>
> It is also important to note that in case your clients only need to use Mansur-Rig's extracted skeleton for a game-engine for example- they do not require Mansur-Rig at all.  
> Mansur-Rig is only required to build/use puppets within Maya. Once the sekeleton/animated-skeleton is extracted, Mansur-Rig is no longer required.

#### Do animators require Mansur-Rig?
> Yes.
> Mansur-Rig is required to build/use puppets created using Mansur-Rig within Maya.
> With that said, Animators only require the lower tier *Silver* license.

<a href="#top">↑ Back to top ↑</a>

#### After extracting the skeleton, do I still need Mansur-Rig?
> No.
> Mansur-Rig is only required to build/use puppets within Maya. Once the sekeleton/animated-skeleton is extracted, Mansur-Rig is no longer required.

<a href="#top">↑ Back to top ↑</a>
<br>
<br>

#### Can I install Mansur-Rig in other softwares other then Maya?
> No.  
> Mansur-Rig is a plugin written specifically for Maya. Although the UI is written in Python, it is based on a dedicated custom C++ node library written using Maya's API, hence running it in any other software other then Maya isn't possible.   
> Transforming Mansur-Rig to other softwares isn't possible as well, just for clarity.

<a href="#top">↑ Back to top ↑</a>
<br>
<br>

#### Can I use Mansur-Rig without an internet conection?
> Currently, No.  
> Mansur-Rig license system is validating against a web-based server. Without an internet connection, your license cannot be validated.  
> Offline authentication is a future possibility, although it is not on the roadmap for now.

<br>
<br>

#### I'm in a studio environment, and I have a firewall. Are there any URL's I need to white-list to use Mansur-Rig?
> Yes.  
> In case you have a firewall preventing you from authenticating Mansur-Rig you need to white-list these URL's:
>
> * https://api.keygen.sh

#### Activation failed. Message: *This seat is already occupied. Couldn't Log-In.*
> This message means that the licensing system detected a "double use" of the same license.  
> If only you are using this license, it means that for some reason your comupter fingerprint has changed.  
> there are a few reasons this could happen:
>
> 1. You are using multiple computers with the saem license (for example a home office and a work computer)
> 2. Your computer fingerprint changed. Maybe because you are using a VPN, or maybe your IP changed.
> 3. You are using different platforms (Windows/Linux) with the same license.
> 
> <br><br>
> If any of the above apply to you, or even if you don't know why this happened, here is what you can do:  
> 
> 1. Go to [Mansur-Rig's Wep-App](#https://app.mansur-rig.com/)
> 2. Log-In to your account.
> 3. Move to *Licenses* tab.
> 4. Locate the license you are trying to activate within the licenses list. It should be indicated as *Occupied*.
> 5. Click the license row to open the drop-down menu.
> 6. Click the *Log-Out* button.
> 7. Your license has now been unoccupied, go back to Maya and activate successfully.

#### Activation failed. Message: *mnsLicDigest command wans't found. Please check your environment.*
> This message means that Mansur-Rig's licensing plugin was not found.  
> If this is the message you are seeing please follow these guides:  
>
> <br>
>
> **Step A**:
>
> 1. In Maya, go to *Windows -> Settings/Preferences -> Plug-In Manager*.
> 2. In the serach bar, type *mnsLicDigest*
> 3. In case you find the plugin and it is unloaded, check both *Loaded* & *Auto-Load* checkboxes, and activate your account successfully.
> 4. In case you don't find the plugin, or it fails to load, move to step B.
> 
> <br>
>
> **Step B**:
>
> 1. In case you can't find *mncLicDigest.mll* in the list, it generally means that you are missing an essential plugin from your installation.
> 2. In most cases, it is a firewall/antivirus deleting this file due to a false threat trigger. These *.mll* files are a subtype of a *.dll* file-type, which are considered a threat by most firewall/antivirus software. I can guarentee all *.mll* plugin included in Mansur-Rig are 100% safe and contain no threat.
> 3. So, what you need to do is restore the missing files. Their location within the installation is here: *.../%Mansur_Rig_Installation_Path%/mnsPlugins/%platform%/%maya_version%*. The best thing to do is create an exception within your firewall/antivirus software to that directory, and simply re-dowloading Mansur-Rig's version to restore these files.
> 4. It is important to say that without these files Mansur-Rig will not function.
> 5. In case you did find *mnsLicDigest* and it simply fails to load, move to step C.
>
> <br>
>
> **step C**
>
> 1. In case *mnsLicDigest* fails to load, i suggest re-downloading and re-installing Mansur-Rig.
> 2. If that doesn't work, please sent a support ticket to *support@mansur-rig.com* explaining your issue, with as much information as possible, including the error message you get when trying to load *mnsLicDigest*

#### Can I use Mansur-Rig to create Facial-Rigs?
> Absolutely.  
> Mansur-Rig contains both sepecificaly designed Facial-Rigging modules, as well as many more sulotions to create high-end Facial-Rigs.  
> Moreover, Mansur-Rig's Facial-Rigging methods are one of it's best strengths, and all of them are joint-based as well, so they are also Game-Engine compatible.  
> Check out some examples over at our [*Art-Station*](#https://www.artstation.com/mansur-rig) profile and our [*You-Tube Channel*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjNlJjSxIam--3u87oh5PQ)

#### What's the difference between Mansur-Rig and other rig-builders?
> * First and foremost, Mansur-Rig's performance is **faster**. It is based on an extensive custom node-library, dedicated to fast performing rigs.  
> * Second, it's ability to be deconstructed will speed-up your workflow tremendously. Instead of building a puppet from pre-defined guides, one-way-steet, it's **one of a kind ability to be decostructed back to guides state** means that your puppet and guides are the same entity.  
> * This in turn means that your **rig building iterations are much faster**. Instead of needing to re-open "guides" file and building again, you simply go back and forth between constructed and decustrected states.  
> * This also means, that **ALL rig information is within one scene**. No longer you need to manage multiple files containing different types of data. Your guides, controls, rig-poses, control shapes, picker information and skin-data are contained within a single Maya scene.  
> * This **unique ability** also allows you to pre-pose your puppet- which is very significant. Instead of being dependent of the Modeling team to deliver a T-Posed model (which isn't optimal), using Mansur-Rig you will be liberated to pre-pose your model, since the skin-data is a part of your rig, instead of being loaded post-construction. The skinning information is preserved in both constructed and deconstructed states, so **you can pose your rig before constrcuting the puppet**. Your animators will feel the difference- it's MASSIVE.  
> * Next, Mansur-Rig's components are to the **highest possible extent of modularity**. Not only you can combine any component with any different one, the components are layered so you can choose the amount of flexibility you provide within your rig based on your performance limitations. You can also connect components using a centralized *spaces* system.
> * Since Mansur-Rig has dual states, **every rig is also a template**. You can use ANY Mansur-Rig's puppet and simply deconstruct it- and just like that you have a guide template. Move components to their new location based on your model, construct, and the puppet will match the original puppet you based you rig on. Of course you can always deconstruct and alter settings/components to your needs.
> * Overall, Mansur-Rig is the single high end One-Stop-Shop for all of your rigging needs. **A production ready proven product, suitable for both offline productions and Game-Engines**.
> * Finally- **completeness**. Mansur-Rig contains many tools for rigging and animation workflows to support it's main behaviour. These tools are a part of the product and don't need to be externaly installed. They are simply there whenever you need them:
> 1. [LOD Tool](../../userGuides/LODs-Tool/)
> 2. [Animation Picker](../../userGuides/The-Picker/)
> 3. [Control Visibility Tool](../../userGuides/Control-Visibility-Tool)
> 4. [CNS Tool](../../userGuides/CNS-Tool/)
> 5. [Spring Tool](../../userGuides/Spring-Tool/)
